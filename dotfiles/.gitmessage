# Remember the 50/72 rule:
# + First line of your commit (the summary) should be a maximum of 50
#   characters. This is for `git shortlog`.
# + All other lines should be a maximum of 72 characters. `git log` adds
#   four spaces of padding, so to center the message on an 80 col
#   terminal, there should be space for four more blank spaces on the
#   right side.
#   (80 - 4 - 4) === 72
