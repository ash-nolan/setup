# Rebind caps lock to escape within the linux terminal.
# Running `showkey` and then hitting escape and then caps lock shows:
#
#   keycode   1 press
#   keycode   1 release
#   keycode  58 press
#   keycode  58 release
#
# Escape is keycode 1 and caps lock is keycode 58.
#
# Running:
#
#   (dumpkeys | grep keymaps; echo "keycode 58 = Escape")
#
# will produce:
#
#   keymaps 0-127
#   keycode 58 = Escape
#
# which when piped into `loadkeys` will remap the keycode 58 (i.e. caps lock) to
# 'Escape' to get the sweet sweet vim-keyboard escape key.
